  transaction={editingTx}
  assets={assets}
  debts={debts} // ADD THIS
  categories={categories}

  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  transaction?: Transaction;
  assets: Asset[];
  debts: Debt[]; // ADD THIS
  categories: Category[];
  onSave: (transaction: any) => void;
}> = ({ isOpen, onClose, transaction, assets, debts, categories, onSave }) => {

  // Update account dropdown:
  <select id="accountId" value={formData.accountId || ''} onChange={handleChange} className={commonInputStyles}>
    <option value="">Select Account</option>
    <optgroup label="Regular Accounts">
      {cashAccounts.map(acc => (
        <option key={acc.id} value={acc.id}>{acc.name}</option>
      ))}
    </optgroup>
