## üîÑ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED FEATURES (2/7)

### 5. üîÑ Chart Time-Based Filtering - 80% Complete
**Status:** Backend ready, UI integration pending

**What's Done:**
- ‚úÖ Updated `generateIncomeExpenseData()` to accept timeFilter parameter
- ‚úÖ Updated `generateNetWorthData()` to accept timeFilter parameter
- ‚úÖ Implemented weekly (last 12 weeks), monthly (last 12 months), yearly (all years) logic
- ‚úÖ Added chartTimeFilter state to Dashboard

**What's Needed (20%):**
1. Add filter button group UI to Dashboard (similar to existing time period selector)
2. Pass chartTimeFilter to chart data generation calls
3. Add filter UI above both "Net Worth" and "Income vs Expense" charts

**Implementation Code Needed:**
```tsx
// In Dashboard component, near the charts:
<div className="flex gap-2 mb-4">
  <button
    onClick={() => setChartTimeFilter('weekly')}
    className={`px-4 py-2 text-sm rounded-lg ${chartTimeFilter === 'weekly' ? 'bg-primary text-white' : 'bg-gray-700 text-gray-300'}`}
  >
    Weekly
  </button>
  <button
    onClick={() => setChartTimeFilter('monthly')}
    className={`px-4 py-2 text-sm rounded-lg ${chartTimeFilter === 'monthly' ? 'bg-primary text-white' : 'bg-gray-700 text-gray-300'}`}
  >
    Monthly
  </button>
  <button
    onClick={() => setChartTimeFilter('yearly')}
    className={`px-4 py-2 text-sm rounded-lg ${chartTimeFilter === 'yearly' ? 'bg-primary text-white' : 'bg-gray-700 text-gray-300'}`}
  >
    Yearly
  </button>
</div>

// Update chart data calls:
const incomeExpenseData = generateIncomeExpenseData(transactions, chartTimeFilter);
const netWorthData = generateNetWorthData(transactions, chartTimeFilter);
```

**Files Modified:**
- `data/mockData.ts`: Lines 218-347 (updated both generate functions)
