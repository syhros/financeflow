- Maximum accounts updated from 6 to 7
- All validation checks updated across dropdowns and manual selection
- UI text updated throughout the dashboard

### 2. Transaction History & Pagination

## üîß Features Requiring Additional Implementation

### Backup & Import (Requires JSZip library)
**Why not implemented**: Requires installing JSZip package which would need:
```bash
npm install jszip
```

**What's needed**:
- Export all data (accounts, debts, settings, transactions, bills, recurring payments, goals) to ZIP
- Import backup functionality to restore from ZIP
- File structure: Each data type as separate JSON file within ZIP

### Recurring Payments Enhancements
**What's needed**:
1. Next payment date calculation based on frequency and last payment
2. Monthly Summary section (similar to Bills & Subscriptions)
3. Upcoming Payments section (payments due within 7 days)
4. Restructured "All Payments" section matching "All Bills" layout
5. Move expense-type recurring payments to Bills section

**Implementation approach**:
- Add `calculateNextPayment()` function using date-fns
- Create summary cards showing total monthly recurring
- Filter payments by due date for upcoming section
- Update Recurring component layout to match Bills
- Update Bills component to include recurring expenses

## Technical Implementation Details

### CSV Import Flow
1. User uploads CSV file
2. Parse CSV and extract transactions
3. Check each transaction's account against existing accounts
4. If unmapped account found:
   - Show AccountMappingModal
   - Wait for user decision (create/skip/map)
   - Store mapping in state
5. Continue processing remaining unmapped accounts
6. Once all mapped, import all transactions
7. Update account balances based on transaction types

### Account Balance Updates
- Income transactions: Add to asset balance, subtract from debt balance
- Expense transactions: Subtract from asset balance, add to debt balance
- Bulk import: Calculate total change per account, then update once

### Type Safety
- All TypeScript interfaces updated
- Props properly typed throughout
- No type errors in build
